Summary of the System
The provided code implements a configurable book caching system that pre-loads books into an in-memory cache during application startup based on configuration properties. The system uses a strategy pattern to determine which books to load:

All books (when history = -1)

Recent books (when history > 0)

No pre-loading (when pre-caching is disabled)

Key components:

BookLoadStrategy: Interface for loading strategies.

AllBooksLoader/HistoricalBooksLoader/NoPreloadBookLoader: Concrete strategies.

BookLookupService: Uses a strategy to populate a cache (Long2ObjectOpenHashMap) at startup and falls back to DB on cache misses.

BookRepository: Data access layer using JdbcTemplate.

BookCacheProperties: Binds configuration properties (book-cache.pre-caching).
